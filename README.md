## Overview
This project implements the **Isolation Forest** algorithm for anomaly detection in a dataset. The Isolation Forest algorithm is designed to identify outliers by isolating observations through a series of random splits.

## Isolation Forest Algorithm

The **Isolation Forest** algorithm is an unsupervised learning method used for anomaly detection. It constructs an ensemble of decision trees (i.e., "forest") and isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and splitting it into random intervals. Anomalies, which are rare or distinct from the normal data points, tend to get isolated early in this process, resulting in shorter paths to isolation compared to normal points.

### Key Features of the Algorithm:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Designed specifically to identify outliers, making it suitable for problems like fraud detection or rare event identification.
- **Efficiency**: Works well on large datasets as it scales linearly with the number of data points and dimensions.
- **Interpretability**: Points are classified as anomalies based on how quickly they are isolated. The shorter the path to isolation, the more likely it is an outlier.

### Effectiveness:
The Isolation Forest is particularly effective because it:
- Does not rely on distance measures, making it robust for high-dimensional data.
- Can detect anomalies in both small and large datasets with minimal tuning, such as adjusting the contamination parameter (the expected proportion of anomalies).
- Handles unscaled data well, though scaling can sometimes improve performance.

This algorithm is widely used in domains like fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and industrial equipment monitoring, where anomalies can indicate critical issues.
